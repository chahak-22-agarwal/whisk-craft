How to use:
1) Unzip the folder.

3) Add product images to images/ with the filenames used in pages (or change the names in HTML).
4) (Optional) Add product videos to videos/ if you want autoplay/controls.
5) Test locally: open index.html in your browser and navigate.
6) Deploy: upload the entire folder to GitHub (enable GitHub Pages), or drag & drop to Netlify/Vercel for instant hosting.
